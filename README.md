Mern's Barbershop App was created as a capstone project for my GA Bootcamp. Built using a full MERN stack and mobile-first thinking, it allows a Mom-and-Pop style barbershop to create services, barbers, and appointments, and accept online bookings.

***

### **Description**
As stated above, the goal for this app was actually pretty simple: let clients book their haircuts online, with the barber/stylist of their choosing. To accomplish this I wanted owners to be able to:
- Add Barbers to the website
- Add service options
- Create appointment slots for their barbers
- View a schedule for each barber
- Update and remove barbers/services/appointments as needed

For the clients, the goals were:
- Be able to book a haircut
- EITHER, be able to view your bookings online
- OR get an email/text confirmation of your booking



The backend of this project was created in a separate repository, and can be seen [here](https://github.com/pauljburgess/Barbershop-back).

### **Credits**

[This](https://kenudeh.hashnode.dev/how-to-build-a-responsive-navigation-menu-with-react) tutorial by Ken Udeh was very helpful in creating the responsive mobile menu.

The [General Assembly](generalassem.ly) lesson on implimenting Auth was followed to create the login feature on this app.
