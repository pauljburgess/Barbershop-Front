Barbershop was created as a capstone project for my GA Bootcamp. Built using a full MERN stack and mobile-first thinking, it allows a Mom-and-Pop style barbershop to accept online bookings.

***

### **Description**
As stated above, the goal for this app was actually pretty simple: let clients book their haircuts online, with the barber/stylist of their choosing. To accomplish this I wanted owners to be able to:
- Add Barbers to the website
- Add cut and wash options
- Create appointment slots for their barbers
- View a schedule for each barber
- Update and remove cuts as needed

For the clients, the goals were:
- Be able to book a haircut
- EITHER, be able to view your bookings online
- OR get an email/text confirmation of your booking
